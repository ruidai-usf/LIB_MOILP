Please prepare the data file contains the following information in this order:
• Number of constraints
• Number of integer variables
• First objective function coefficients
• Second objective function coefficients
• Constraints coefficient matrix for integer variables
• Right hand side value of each constraint
• A binary value indicating the type of constraint. A zero means an = constraint and a one means a ≤ constraint.
